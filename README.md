*Purpose:* To organize code for the BISD Tech Student Employees group and **provide a platform to begin developing an inventory application**.

*Languages:* Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript

*Contributers:* Isaac Sueltenfuss, Ryan Berberek, Grant Friar, Austin Skiba, Carson Champie, John Matamoros

**Step By Step:**
1) Begin planning for inventory application. Refresh on Java learning while ensuring all members have relevant software.
2) Compile *initial* list of all equipment for the inventory. Separate into 'categories'.
3) Make a *basic* website draft to display the equipment list and its categories, as well as allow one to add more items.
4) Account based log-in system for security.
5) Remove items from equipment list functionality.
6) In the categories, update to include:
	-  item name
	-  type of device (e.g speaker, laptop, printer)
	-  location
	-  **issues with the device**
7) Work on image functionality.
	- The ability to take a picture of an item and attach it to the item listing.

**Advanced Functions:**
* Barcode scanning for repair tracking. 
	* This would work in tandem with device status, being late stage, after *everything else*.
